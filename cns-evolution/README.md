# Conserved non-coding sequence analysis in the PanAnd clade

The analysis of conserved non-coding sequences was split into 6 sub-analyses documented in this repo.

* `1_subgenomes`: Identifying subgenomes among polyploid and ancient polyploid species based on synteny to the ancestral genome of the outgroup Paspalum vaginatum
* `2_multiple_alignment`: Aligning the genomes of all PanAnd species
* `3_conserved_sequences`: Identifying conserved sequences from the multiple alignment
* `4_accelerated_sequence`: Inferring Tripsacineae-specific accelerated sequences 
* `5_syntenic_genes`: Determining syntenic genes based on ortholog clustering and collinearity
* `6_tfbs`: Analysis of turnover of transcription factor binding sites between maize and other PanAnd species
