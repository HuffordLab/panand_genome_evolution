### panand genome evolution paper related scripts and workflows

Please follow this structure for your contribution.

1. Place all scripts related to a specific task inside a folder with an appropriately chosen name (e.g., `genome-assembly`). Use hyphens to separate words and utilize all lowercase letters (if feasible).

2. Include a `README.md` file within the folder, explicitly detailing the employed programs, their order in the workflow, necessary inputs, and the corresponding scripts used.

3. Create a sub-folder for figures, and store both the source code and the associated `png`/`pdf`/`tiff` files within it. If the file size is small, you may also put the input data in this sub-folder.

4. Place all mentioned scripts from the `README.md` and any input files (with a size smaller than <1Mb) into an `assets` sub-directory. Similarly, anything that doesn't qualify as a script or input should also go here.

5. After finalizing your section, ensure to link the `README.md` file in the table of contents with an appropriate title for your section.

6. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
